      <description>aws-dynamodb-copy is a simple script that allows you to copy the contents of a DynamoDB table into another table on the same AWS region.
The script doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide any fancy features. It scans the source table using a parallel scan and writes the items to the target tables in batches. The rate at which items are copied can be tuned to suit the capacity allocated to the target and source tables.</description>

      <description>The aws-s3-basic-auth project contains a setup for protecting access to S3 bucket with HTTP Basic Authentication.
The setup creates a CloudFront distribution for serving files from the target bucket. A custom Lambda@Edge function is used to authenticate all requests made to the CloudFront distribution. CloudFront authenticates itself to S3 using a custom Origin Access Identity which prevents direct access to the contents of S3.
The entire setup can be deployed through CloudFormation to protect access to any existing S3 bucket.</description>
