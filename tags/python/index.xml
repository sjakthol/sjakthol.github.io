      <description>This simulator was developed to measure the efficiency of an encrypted data deduplication protocol for cloud storage service providers. The protocol was developed by the Secure Systems group at the Aalto University School of Science.
This simulator consists of various components that can be used to measure the efficiency of the deduplication protocol. These components are:
 Dataset Collector - Collects file size and popularity data from UNIX systems. Upload Request Stream Generator - Generates a stream of upload requests from the collected datasets.</description>
